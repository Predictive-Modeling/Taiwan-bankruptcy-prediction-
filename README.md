## Abstract
Accurate bankruptcy prediction is essential for financial institutions to make
better lending decisions. The effectiveness of such predictions mainly depends on the
data used and the methods applied. While many studies focus on refining prediction
techniques, few have examined which types of data are most useful for predicting
bankruptcy.Research indicates that both financial data and corporate governance
factors are important in predicting bankruptcy. However, few studies have explored the
combined effect of these two data types on prediction accuracy. Additionally, the choice
of data varies across studies, with no clear agreement on which factors are most
critical.This study aims to assess the impact of combining various financial and
governance data on bankruptcy prediction. Using data from Taiwan, the results show
that certain financial and governance characteristics are most influential in predicting
bankruptcy.

## Background
Bankruptcy or business failure can harm both the company involved and the
wider economy. For years, business experts, investors, governments, and researchers
have been trying to find ways to spot the risk of a company failing, to help reduce the
financial damage caused by bankruptcy (Balleisen, 2001; Zywicki, 2008).
In the United States, approximately 18,926 bankruptcy cases were filed in 2023,
marking a 40% increase from the previous year (US Courts, 2024). These bankruptcy
cases can lead to significant economic disruptions in communities that rely on
businesses for services and household income. When a company goes bankrupt, it
often results in layoffs, contributing to an increase in unemployment and a decline in
economic activity in affected areas. Additionally, investors are impacted as they are less
likely to receive the full value of their investments in the company, further exacerbating
the financial strain on the community.
Recent research has witnessed the emergence of innovative statistical and
machine learning methods aimed at predicting business bankruptcy earlier, with the
goal of mitigating the impact of business failures. The Altman Z-score model (Anjum,
2012), introduced in 1968, remains one of the earliest and most influential predictive
models in this field. Its enduring relevance has inspired contemporary academic
researchers to build upon its foundation, striving to enhance predictive capabilities and
develop more novel bankruptcy forecasting tools.
A significant challenge in developing these models is identifying relevant financial
indicators that contribute to bankruptcies. The most common approach involves using
financial ratios, which are readily accessible through quarterly financial statements
published by public companies. These ratios provide insights into a company's financial
health and potential risk of bankruptcy, allowing researchers to create more accurate
prediction models.
