## Abstract.............................................................................................................................

Accurate bankruptcy prediction is essential for financial institutions to make
better lending decisions. The effectiveness of such predictions mainly depends on the
data used and the methods applied. While many studies focus on refining prediction
techniques, few have examined which types of data are most useful for predicting
bankruptcy.Research indicates that both financial data and corporate governance
factors are important in predicting bankruptcy. However, few studies have explored the
combined effect of these two data types on prediction accuracy. Additionally, the choice
of data varies across studies, with no clear agreement on which factors are most
critical.This study aims to assess the impact of combining various financial and
governance data on bankruptcy prediction. Using data from Taiwan, the results show
that certain financial and governance characteristics are most influential in predicting
bankruptcy.
